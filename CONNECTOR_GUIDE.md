# Interactive Connector Selection Guide

## Overview
The Interactive Connector Selection Guide is a 5-step wizard that helps engineers and customers find the perfect connector for their application. It's located at `/resources/connector-guide`.

## Features

### 1. **Multi-Step Wizard Interface**
- Clean, modern UI using shadcn/ui components
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Step-by-step navigation with validation
- Mobile-responsive design

### 2. **Five Selection Steps**

#### Step 1: Application Type
Select the type of connection needed:
- **Wire-to-Wire**: Socket (Female) + Tab (Male) connectors
- **Wire-to-Board**: Socket (Female) + PCB Header
- **Board-to-Board**: PCB Header + PCB Header

#### Step 2: Pole Count
Choose the number of circuits/wires (2-12 poles)
- Visual grid layout with icons
- Clear indication of selected option

#### Step 3: Orientation
Select mounting orientation:
- **Horizontal**: Parallel to board/wire (space-constrained)
- **Vertical**: Perpendicular to board/wire (better cable management)
- **Either**: Show both options for comparison

#### Step 4: Special Requirements (Optional)
Additional filters:
- Locking mechanism required
- Special versions (FR, VR, VS, VT, FT variants)
- Specific keying requirements

#### Step 5: Results Display
Shows matching connectors organized by gender:
- **Socket Connectors** (Female) - Blue badges
- **Tab Connectors** (Male) - Orange badges
- **PCB Headers** (PCB) - Green badges

### 3. **Smart Filtering Logic**

The wizard queries the Supabase database with the following filters:

```typescript
// Base filters always applied
- pole_count: exact match
- gender: based on application type

// Optional filters
- orientation: Horizontal/Vertical (or both if "Either")
- is_special_version: true/false based on checkbox
```

### 4. **Result Cards**
Each matching connector displays:
- 360° video preview with autoplay
- Model number and display name
- Gender, pole count, and orientation badges
- Special version indicator if applicable
- "View Details" button linking to full connector page

### 5. **User Experience Features**
- Validation on each step before proceeding
- Back navigation to revise selections
- Loading states during data fetching
- Empty state messaging if no matches found
- "Start Over" button to reset wizard
- Smooth transitions between steps

## Technical Implementation

### Components Used
- `Card`, `CardContent`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription` - Layout
- `Button` - Navigation and actions
- `Badge` - Visual indicators
- `RadioGroup`, `RadioGroupItem` - Single selection
- `Label` - Accessible form labels
- `Checkbox` - Multiple selection
- `Progress` - Visual progress indicator

### State Management
```typescript
interface WizardState {
  applicationType: 'wire-to-wire' | 'wire-to-board' | 'board-to-board' | null
  poleCount: number | null
  orientation: 'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'either' | null
  requiresLocking: boolean
  specialVersion: boolean
  specificKeying: boolean
}
```

### Data Fetching
- Uses Supabase client for real-time database queries
- Fetches different connector types based on application selection
- Applies filters dynamically based on user choices
- Handles loading and error states gracefully

### Styling
- Gradient backgrounds (blue-50 to white)
- Hover effects on interactive elements
- Active selection highlights (blue-500 borders)
- Responsive grid layouts
- Consistent with existing design system

## Database Schema Requirements

The wizard queries the `connectors` table with these columns:
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `model` - Model number
- `display_name` - Friendly name
- `gender` - Female/Male/PCB
- `pole_count` - Number of poles (2-12)
- `orientation` - Horizontal/Vertical/null
- `is_special_version` - boolean
- `video_360_url` - Path to 360° video
- `category` - Connector category
- `terminal_suffix` - Terminal type

## Navigation

### Access Points
1. **Resources Page**: `/resources`
   - Featured card with "Launch Selection Guide" button
   - Highlighted with green accent color

2. **Direct URL**: `/resources/connector-guide`

### Navigation Flow
```
Resources → Connector Guide → Step 1-5 → Results → Connector Detail Page
                                   ↓
                              Back to refine
                                   ↓
                              Start over
```

## Example User Journey

1. User lands on Resources page
2. Clicks "Launch Selection Guide"
3. Selects "Wire-to-Wire" application
4. Chooses "4-pole" configuration
5. Picks "Horizontal" orientation
6. Optionally checks "Locking mechanism"
7. Views results showing matching sockets and tabs
8. Clicks "View Details" on a connector
9. Reviews full specifications and compatibility
10. Either navigates back to refine or starts over for new search

## Performance

- Client-side component for instant interactivity
- Progressive loading with suspense boundaries
- Optimized bundle size: ~45.8 kB
- Fast database queries with indexed columns
- Video autoplay for immediate visual feedback

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Save search results to user profile
- Compare multiple connectors side-by-side
- Export results as PDF specification sheet
- Email results link
- Recent searches history
- Advanced filtering (current rating, temperature range)
- Compatibility checking with existing connectors
- Bill of materials (BOM) generation

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper ARIA labels via Label components
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader friendly
- High contrast color schemes

## Browser Support

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)
- Progressive enhancement approach
- No JavaScript fallback messaging

## Maintenance

### Adding New Steps
To add additional wizard steps:
1. Increase `totalSteps` constant
2. Add new step component in conditional render
3. Update `isStepValid()` logic
4. Modify `fetchResults()` to include new filter
5. Update progress calculation

### Modifying Filters
To change filtering logic:
1. Update `WizardState` interface
2. Modify query building in `fetchResults()`
3. Update UI in step components
4. Test with database indexes

### Styling Changes
All styles use Tailwind CSS classes and can be modified inline or extracted to custom components for reusability.
