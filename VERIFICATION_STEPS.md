# Checkbox Fix Verification Steps

## Quick Test (2 minutes)

1. **Open the catalog page:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/catalog
   ```

2. **Test Desktop Checkboxes:**
   - Click on "Female" checkbox under Gender → Should check/uncheck
   - Click on "Horizontal" checkbox under Orientation → Should check/uncheck
   - Click on "Show only special versions" → Should check/uncheck

3. **Verify URL Updates:**
   - When you check "Female", URL should change to: `?gender=Female`
   - When you check "Horizontal", URL should add: `&orientation=Horizontal`

4. **Verify Filtering Works:**
   - Check "3" under Pole Count (button-based filter)
   - The connector list should update to show only 3-pole connectors
   - The counter should update: "X of Y connectors"

5. **Test Mobile View:**
   - Resize browser to mobile width (< 1024px)
   - Click "Filters" button to expand
   - Check "Show only special versions" checkbox
   - Should work the same as desktop

## What Was Fixed

The checkbox component now properly forwards refs to the Radix UI primitive, which allows:
- ✓ Click events to be registered
- ✓ Focus management to work
- ✓ Keyboard navigation (Tab and Space)
- ✓ ARIA attributes to be applied
- ✓ Proper pointer-events handling

## Browser DevTools Check

Open browser console (F12) and verify:
```javascript
// No errors in console
// React DevTools should show "Checkbox" components with proper names
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix:
- Clicking checkboxes did nothing
- No visual feedback
- URL didn't update
- Filtering didn't work

### After Fix:
- Clicking checkboxes toggles checked state
- Visual checkmark appears/disappears
- URL updates with selected filters
- Connector list filters correctly
- Keyboard navigation works
- Focus indicators visible

## Technical Verification

Run these commands to verify the fix is in place:

```bash
# Check the component has forwardRef
grep -n "forwardRef" src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx

# Check displayName is set
grep -n "displayName" src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx

# Verify no TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Verify build succeeds
npm run build
```

All should pass without errors.
