## Server Actions

**File:** `/app/[locale]/admin/users/actions.ts`

All server actions implemented with:
- ✅ TypeScript strict typing
- ✅ Permission checks
- ✅ Audit logging
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Revalidation

### Actions:

1. **`createAdminUser(data)`**
   - Creates auth user in Supabase Auth
   - Creates admin_users record
   - Only super_admin can create other super_admins
   - Email and password validation
   - Rollback on failure
   - Returns: `ActionResult<AdminUser>`

2. **`getAdminUsers(filters?)`**
   - Fetches all admin users
   - Optional filters: role, is_active, search
   - Returns: `ActionResult<AdminUser[]>`

3. **`getAdminUserById(id)`**
   - Fetches single user by ID
   - Returns: `ActionResult<AdminUser>`

4. **`updateAdminUser(userId, data)`**
   - Updates user details
   - Prevents self-deactivation
   - Prevents self-demotion from super_admin
   - Only super_admin can promote to super_admin
   - Tracks changes for audit log
   - Returns: `ActionResult<AdminUser>`

5. **`deleteAdminUser(userId)`**
   - Soft deletes user (sets is_active = false)
   - Prevents self-deletion
   - Returns: `ActionResult`

6. **`restoreAdminUser(userId)`**
   - Restores soft-deleted user
   - Sets is_active = true
   - Returns: `ActionResult`

---

## Security Features

### Permission Checks
All operations enforce role-based permissions:
- **Create User:** Requires `users:create`
- **Read Users:** Requires `users:read`
- **Update User:** Requires `users:update`
- **Delete User:** Requires `users:delete`

### Business Rules
1. **Cannot delete yourself** - Prevents accidental self-lockout
2. **Cannot deactivate yourself** - Prevents accidental self-lockout
3. **Cannot change your own super_admin role** - Prevents accidental self-demotion
4. **Only super_admin can create/promote super_admins** - Prevents privilege escalation

### Audit Logging
All user management actions are logged with:
- Action type (create, update, delete)
- Resource type (admin_user)
- Resource ID (user ID)
- Resource description (email, role)
- Changes made (before/after values)
- Performing user ID
- IP address, user agent, timestamp
- Request method and path

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Optimistic UI Updates:** User list refreshes after actions
2. **Loading States:** All async operations show loading indicators
3. **Server Components:** Page structure uses Server Components
4. **Client Components:** Interactive parts use Client Components
5. **Revalidation:** Next.js cache revalidation after mutations

---

## Accessibility

- ✅ Proper ARIA labels
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Focus management in dialogs
- ✅ Color contrast compliant
- ✅ Screen reader friendly
- ✅ Form validation messages

---

## Error Handling

### Types of Errors Handled:
1. **Authentication Errors:** User not logged in
2. **Permission Errors:** Insufficient permissions
3. **Validation Errors:** Invalid form data
4. **Business Logic Errors:** Self-deletion, role restrictions
5. **Database Errors:** Connection issues, constraint violations
6. **Network Errors:** Request failures

### Error Display:
- Toast notifications for all errors
- Inline form validation errors
- Clear error messages
- Proper error logging to console

---

## Future Enhancements (Not in Current Scope)

1. Bulk user operations
2. User export (CSV, Excel)
3. User import
4. Password reset functionality
5. Two-factor authentication
6. User activity dashboard
7. Advanced search with multiple filters
8. Sorting columns
9. Pagination for large datasets
10. User profile photos
