## Known Dependencies (Not Yet Blockers)

### Work Package 1B: Authentication System
**Depends On:** Work Package 1A (Database Foundation)
**Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting
**Reason:** Needs `admin_users` table to be created
**ETA to Unblock:** Day 2 (after 1A completes)
**Assigned To:** Fullstack-Feature-Owner

### Work Package 1D: RBAC System

**Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting
**Reason:** Needs auth utilities and session management
**ETA to Unblock:** Day 4-5 (after 1B completes)
**Assigned To:** Fullstack-Feature-Owner

### Work Package 1E: Integration & Polish
**Depends On:** All Sprint 1 work packages (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D)
**Status:** ‚è≥ Waiting
**Reason:** Needs all components to integrate
**ETA to Unblock:** Day 6 (after 1A-1D complete)

## External Dependencies

### Supabase Project Setup
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete (existing project)
**Required For:** Database migrations

### Resend Email Service (Phase 2)
**Status:** ‚è≥ Future
**Required For:** Inquiry email notifications (Sprint 5-6)

## Risk Items (Potential Future Blockers)

### 1. Supabase Auth Configuration Complexity
**Risk Level:** üü° Medium
**Impact:** Could delay authentication implementation
**Mitigation:** Start with simple email/password; defer OAuth to Phase 2

### 2. RLS Policy Testing
**Risk Level:** üü° Medium
**Impact:** Security vulnerabilities if policies are incorrect
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive security testing; manual policy review by team

### 3. Next.js Middleware Performance
**Risk Level:** üü¢ Low
**Impact:** Slow auth checks on every request
**Mitigation:** Optimize middleware; cache session checks; use Edge runtime
