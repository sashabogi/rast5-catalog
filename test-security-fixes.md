# Security Fixes Testing Guide

This document provides step-by-step testing procedures for the 3 high-priority security fixes.

---

## Test 1: Login Rate Limiting

### Objective
Verify that brute force attacks are prevented with proper rate limiting.

### Prerequisites
- Application running locally or deployed
- Admin login page accessible at `/en/admin/login`

### Test Steps

#### Test 1.1: Rate Limit Enforcement
```
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/en/admin/login
2. Enter INCORRECT credentials and click "Sign In" - Attempt 1
3. Enter INCORRECT credentials and click "Sign In" - Attempt 2
4. Enter INCORRECT credentials and click "Sign In" - Attempt 3
5. Enter INCORRECT credentials and click "Sign In" - Attempt 4
6. Enter INCORRECT credentials and click "Sign In" - Attempt 5
7. Enter INCORRECT credentials and click "Sign In" - Attempt 6

Expected Results:
✓ Attempts 1-5: Show error message "Invalid login credentials"
✓ Attempt 6: Show error message "Too many login attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes."
✓ Submit button becomes disabled with text "Locked (15m)"
✓ Further submit attempts are blocked
```

#### Test 1.2: Successful Login Reset
```
1. Clear rate limit (refresh page or wait 15 minutes)
2. Enter INCORRECT credentials 4 times
3. Enter CORRECT credentials on 5th attempt
4. Verify successful login and redirect to dashboard
5. Log out and try logging in again
6. Verify you can attempt 5 new tries (counter was reset)

Expected Results:
✓ Successful login occurs on 5th attempt
✓ Rate limit counter resets after successful authentication
✓ New login attempts allowed after logout
```

#### Test 1.3: Cross-Browser Isolation
```
1. In Browser A (Chrome): Make 5 failed login attempts
2. In Browser B (Firefox): Try to log in
3. Verify Browser B is NOT blocked

Expected Results:
✓ Each browser has independent rate limit
✓ Blocking one browser doesn't affect others
```

### Pass Criteria
- [x] Maximum 5 attempts allowed per client
- [x] 6th attempt shows lockout message
- [x] Submit button disabled during lockout
- [x] Lockout shows remaining time
- [x] Successful login resets counter
- [x] Different browsers have separate limits

## Test 2: Audit Log RLS Policy

### Objective
Verify that audit log INSERT is restricted to service role only.

### Prerequisites
- Supabase project with migration applied
- Database access (SQL Editor or psql)
- Authenticated user session

### Test Steps

#### Test 2.1: Migration Application
```sql
-- Connect to database
supabase db push

-- OR manually run:
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20250109000006_fix_audit_logs_rls.sql
```

Expected Results:
```
✓ Migration completes without errors
✓ Policies created successfully
✓ Function updated successfully
```

#### Test 2.2: Verify Policies
```sql
-- Check policies on audit_logs table
SELECT
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  roles,
  cmd,
  with_check
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename = 'audit_logs'
ORDER BY policyname;
```

Expected Results:
```
policyname                           | roles          | cmd    | with_check
-------------------------------------|----------------|--------|------------
Application can insert via RPC       | authenticated  | INSERT | false
Content managers can read...         | authenticated  | SELECT | ...
Service role can insert audit logs   | service_role   | INSERT | true
Super admins can read all...         | authenticated  | SELECT | ...
Users can view their own...          | authenticated  | SELECT | ...
```

#### Test 2.3: Test Direct INSERT (Should Fail)
```sql
-- Attempt direct INSERT as authenticated user
-- This should fail with permission denied
INSERT INTO public.audit_logs (
  user_id,
  action,
  resource_type,
  resource_description
) VALUES (
  auth.uid(),
  'test',
  'admin_user',
  'Direct insert test - should fail'
);
```

Expected Results:
```
✗ ERROR: new row violates row-level security policy for table "audit_logs"
✓ Direct INSERT blocked successfully
```

#### Test 2.4: Test Function INSERT (Should Succeed)
```sql
-- Insert via log_admin_action function
-- This should succeed
SELECT public.log_admin_action(
  auth.uid(),
  'read',
  'admin_user',
  NULL,
  'Test audit log via function',
  '{"test": true, "migration": "20250109000006"}'::jsonb
);
```

Expected Results:
```
✓ Returns UUID of created log entry
✓ Function INSERT works correctly
```

#### Test 2.5: Verify Log Was Created
```sql
-- Check that the log was created
SELECT
  id,
  user_email,
  action,
  resource_type,
  resource_description,
  details,
  created_at
FROM public.audit_logs
WHERE details->>'test' = 'true'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Expected Results:
```
✓ Log entry exists
✓ All fields populated correctly
✓ created_at timestamp is recent
```

#### Test 2.6: Test in Admin Panel
```
1. Log in to admin panel
2. Navigate to User Management
3. Create/edit/delete a user
4. Check browser console for audit log confirmation
5. Query audit_logs table to verify entries

Expected Results:
✓ Admin actions create audit logs
✓ No errors in console
✓ Audit logs contain correct information
```

### Pass Criteria
- [x] Migration runs without errors
- [x] Direct INSERT by authenticated users fails
- [x] log_admin_action() function succeeds
- [x] Audit logs created correctly
- [x] Existing logs preserved
- [x] Admin panel logging works

## Test 3: Error Boundaries

### Objective
Verify that component errors are caught gracefully without crashing the UI.

### Prerequisites
- Application running in development mode
- Admin panel accessible
- Browser dev tools open

### Test Steps

#### Test 3.1: Simulate Component Error
```typescript
// Temporarily modify any admin component to throw an error
// For example, in src/app/[locale]/admin/dashboard/page.tsx:

export default function DashboardPage() {
  // Add this line to throw a test error
  if (true) throw new Error('Test error boundary')

  return <div>Dashboard</div>
}
```

#### Test 3.2: Navigate to Affected Page
```
1. Navigate to the page with the error (e.g., /en/admin/dashboard)
2. Observe the error boundary UI

Expected Results:
✓ Error boundary catches the error
✓ No white screen of death
✓ Fallback UI displays with:
  - Red alert triangle icon
  - "Something went wrong" heading
  - Error message: "Test error boundary"
  - Error stack trace (in development only)
  - "Try Again" button
  - "Reload Page" button
  - Help text at bottom
```

#### Test 3.3: Test "Try Again" Button
```
1. Click the "Try Again" button
2. Observe behavior

Expected Results:
✓ Component re-renders
✓ If error still exists, fallback UI shows again
✓ If error removed, normal UI displays
```

#### Test 3.4: Test "Reload Page" Button
```
1. Click the "Reload Page" button
2. Observe behavior

Expected Results:
✓ Browser performs full page reload
✓ Application state resets
✓ Page loads normally (if error fixed)
```

#### Test 3.5: Test UI Isolation
```typescript
// Create a page with error boundary around specific component
<div>
  <h1>Dashboard</h1>

  <ErrorBoundary>
    <ComponentWithError />
  </ErrorBoundary>

  <div>
    <h2>Other Content</h2>
    <p>This should still render</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Expected Results:
```
✓ Only ComponentWithError section shows error UI
✓ Rest of page renders normally
✓ Other components remain interactive
✓ Error doesn't propagate to parent
```

#### Test 3.6: Remove Test Error
```typescript
// Remove the test error from component
// export default function DashboardPage() {
//   // Remove: if (true) throw new Error('Test error boundary')
//   return <div>Dashboard</div>
// }
```

#### Test 3.7: Verify Production Behavior
```
1. Build application: npm run build
2. Start production server: npm start
3. Navigate to page that previously had error
4. Error boundary should hide stack traces in production

Expected Results:
✓ Error message shown
✓ Stack trace HIDDEN in production
✓ Only user-friendly message displayed
✓ "Try Again" and "Reload Page" buttons available
```

### Pass Criteria
- [x] Component errors caught gracefully
- [x] Fallback UI displays correctly
- [x] Error details shown in development
- [x] Stack traces hidden in production
- [x] "Try Again" button resets error
- [x] "Reload Page" button refreshes browser
- [x] Granular error boundaries work
- [x] Rest of UI remains functional

## Additional Security Tests

### Test 4: Combined Scenario
```
Scenario: Attacker attempts brute force while tampering with logs

1. Open browser dev tools
2. Attempt to manipulate audit_logs table via console
3. Try 6 failed login attempts
4. Attempt to clear rate limit via console
5. Try to throw error to crash admin panel

Expected Results:
✓ Audit log manipulation blocked by RLS
✓ Rate limit enforced despite console tampering
✓ Error caught by error boundary
✓ All security controls working together
```

### Test 5: Performance Impact
```
1. Measure login page load time before fixes
2. Measure login page load time after fixes
3. Compare performance impact

Expected Results:
✓ Minimal performance impact (<50ms difference)
✓ No noticeable lag in user experience
✓ Rate limiting adds negligible overhead
```

## Rollback Procedures

### If Rate Limiting Causes Issues
```typescript
// In src/app/[locale]/admin/login/page.tsx
// Comment out rate limit check:
/*
const rateLimitCheck = checkRateLimit(clientId)
if (!rateLimitCheck.allowed) {
  setIsRateLimited(true)
  setRemainingTime(rateLimitCheck.remainingTime || 15)
  setError(`Too many login attempts...`)
  return
}
*/
```

### If Audit Log RLS Breaks Logging
```sql
-- Run rollback section from migration file:
BEGIN;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Service role can insert audit logs" ON public.audit_logs;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Application can insert via RPC" ON public.audit_logs;

CREATE POLICY "System can insert audit logs"
    ON public.audit_logs
    FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (true);

GRANT INSERT ON public.audit_logs TO authenticated;

COMMIT;
```

### If Error Boundary Causes Issues
```typescript
// In src/app/[locale]/admin/layout.tsx
// Remove ErrorBoundary wrapper:
// Before:
<ErrorBoundary>
  {children}
</ErrorBoundary>

// After:
<>
  {children}
</>
```
